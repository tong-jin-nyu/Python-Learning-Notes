    "It's pretty much a Nintendo with a keyboard and a bunch of game cards designed for \"learning\". One of them is called \"[LOGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)\", a programming language developed by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966. The main feature is to manipulate a turtle (brush) to draw any figure you want: letters, cars, mario characters.... As a kid, I found it so interesting that I gave it a special time slot between playing Contra and Nintendo World Cup. Surrounded by DOS-like interfaces, I was obsessed with the possibility of LOGO in creating beautiful graphs on my screen. One year later, Window 95 was launched and I couldn't keep myself from borrowing my auntie's computer, just for Minesweeper or Banana Wars. Windows made me officially say goodbye to DOS, but LOGO was one of the treasures that, sometimes, reminds me of the good of command lines. It also made me rethink of coding: those tedious command lines can actually create cool things. \n",
