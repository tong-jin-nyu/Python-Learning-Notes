One of them is called \"[LOGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language))\", a programming language developed by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966.

LOGO let me see the beauty of a graphical interface. One year later, Window 95 was launched and I couldn't keep myself from borrowing my auntie's computer, just for Minesweeper or Banana Wars. Ah, such good memories..."
